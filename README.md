# Protractor Robot Remote 

A wrapper around robotremote that adds Protractor integration to the Node remote server for the Robot Framework.

Let your developers write Protractor page objects for all of your views, using Javascript and Protractor API.
Then your testers can write robot tests with keywords that invoke methods on these page objects.

This pattern helps to keep clear separation between your page objects and your test cases and makes it easer for non-developer testers to write automated tests.
